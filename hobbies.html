				<p> I love to be active!  I'm currently getting ready to run a half marathon in November, so I've been running a lot.  I also play club field hockey here at UW-Madison which is a lot of fun! </p>

				<p> One of my favorite things to do with my friends is watch reality TV!  Last year we watched 19 Kids & Counting and Counting On with the Duggar Family and this year we watched Sister Wives.  We also watch Bachelor, Bachelorette, or Bachelor in Paradise every week.</p>
